MSP430 G Series Econo Launchpad
===============================
This is the PCB design for the TI MSP430 Economy Launchpad. It fits in a 5cm x 5xm area and does not include the programmer. You can buy an official launchpad and then use this to make standalone Launchpads. This is NOT the official design but rather my version.

The project is at www.github.com/inderpreet/MSP430Econopad

Format is EagleCAD schematic and board layout
